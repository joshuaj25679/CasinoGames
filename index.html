            Blackjack is usually played at a table of 2-7 players and uses one to eight 52-card decks. 
            <br> All number cards (2-10) score the value indicated on them. The face cards (Jack, Queen, King) score 10 points and Ace can either be treated as 1 or 11.
            At the beginning of each round, all players place their bets in their betting positions - also known as ‘boxes’. 
            <br>After the bets have been placed, all players are dealt two cards face-up in front of their respective betting positions. The dealer receives two cards, one face-up and another face-down.
            Starting to the left of the dealer, each player is given a chance to draw more cards. The players can either ‘hit’ or ‘stand’.
            <br>If the player calls out ‘HIT’, they are given an extra card. They can then either call out ‘HIT’ again, or ‘STAND’ if they do not wish to draw any more cards.
            The player can ‘HIT’ as many times as they wish, but have to aim not to ‘bust’ (exceed a total of 21).If the player busts, they immediately lose their bet.
            <br>After each player has played and either stood or busted, the dealer takes their turn. They can, again, either ‘HIT’ or ‘STAND’. 
            If the dealer’s hand exceeds 21, all players who didn't bust win immediately - their bet is returned along with a matching amount from the dealer's bank.
            <br>If the dealer reaches a valid hand, the cards are totalled and each player’s hand is compared to the dealer’s. 
            If the player scored higher than the dealer, they win. If the player ties with the dealer, the original bet is returned to the player. Otherwise, the player loses their bet.
            <br>A perfect hand combines an ace with a 10, Jack, Queen or King and is known as a ‘Blackjack’.

                In North America and the Caribbean, roulette wheels have a double zero, and all bets (except a direct bet on the selected zero) are lost when either zero turns up. 
                <br>The result is significantly poorer odds for the punter and an increase in the Casino's cut.
                <br>This is probably why in this region, Roulette is less popular than it is in other parts of the world.
                <br>The rules are the same as for European Roulette above except that the double zero works in the same way as a single zero result.
                <br>Some American casinos do allow an additional bet called a "basket bet" which is staked by placing chips in the same way as for a line bet on the outside of the the dividing line between the zero row and the row featuring 1, 2 and 3.
                <br>This bet normally pays out 6 to 1 which gives it odds worse than any other roulette bet.
